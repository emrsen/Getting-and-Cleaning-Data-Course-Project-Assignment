** Given features and selection methods can be found in downloadd data set **

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

## Tidy data is the mean of the values by testing individual(subject), activity type, data source (train/test) and the same list of the values in 'features.txt'
